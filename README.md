Restaurant Table Reservation System
1.Project Overview:
The Restaurant Table Reservation System is a desktop application designed to streamline table
management and booking coordination in restaurants. It addresses critical operational challenges
including double-bookings, lack of real-time availability tracking, and inefficient customer data
management. By automating manual reservation processes, the system enhances both customer
satisfaction and restaurant operational efficiency through real-time tracking and comprehensive
validation mechanisms.
Real-Time Application Requirements:
1. Customer Management System
Functional Requirements:
● Add customer during booking with seamless registration
● Store customer name, email, and phone number
● View, edit, and maintain customer records
● Prevent duplicate entries using email uniqueness
● Search customers by name, email, or phone
● Validate email format and phone number
2. Table Management System
Functional Requirements:
● Maintain database of all restaurant tables
● Configure table number, capacity, and location
● Track real-time availability status
● Show only available tables during booking
● Filter tables by capacity, location, and availability
● Prevent overbooking based on guest count vs capacity
3. Reservation Booking System
Functional Requirements:
● Create reservations with multi-step validation
● Select existing customer or add new during booking
● Use DatePicker for date selection
● Select from predefined time slots
● Input guest count with validation
● Display only available tables for selected date/time
● Provide instant booking confirmation
4. Availability Check System
Functional Requirements:
● Check real-time table availability
● Detect reservation conflicts
● Prevent double-booking at database and application level
● Filter tables dynamically by date/time/capacity
● Provide instant unavailability feedback
● Suggest alternative available tables
5. Reservation Cancellation System
Functional Requirements:
● Change status from "Confirmed" to "Cancelled"
● Confirm cancellation with dialog
● Use soft delete (status update, not deletion)
● Maintain audit trail of cancelled reservations
● Make cancelled slots immediately available
● Restrict cancellation to "Confirmed" reservations only
6. Reservation Filtering and Viewing System
Functional Requirements:
● Display all reservations in TableView
● Filter today's reservations with quick button
● Filter by specific date using DatePicker
● Filter by status (Confirmed, Cancelled, Completed)
● Display customer name, table, date, time, guests, status
● Sort by date, time, customer name, or status
● Search by customer name or table number
7. Data Persistence System
Functional Requirements:
● Use Hibernate ORM for all database operations
● Implement DAO pattern for each entity
● Support CRUD operations
● Handle transactions with commit/rollback
● Manage Hibernate session lifecycle
● Use C3P0 connection pooling
Technical Implementation:
● CustomerDAO, RestaurantTableDAO, ReservationDAO
● HibernateUtil for SessionFactory management
● BaseDAO<T> for generic CRUD methods
8. Validation and Alert System
Functional Requirements:
● Validate input at UI level
● Prevent past date selection
● Validate email format with regex
● Ensure guest count doesn't exceed capacity
● Require all mandatory fields
● Display error messages and confirmations
● Show success notifications
Validation Rules:
● Email: Email must contain alphanumeric characters, plus signs, underscores, periods, or
hyphens before the @ symbol, followed by a domain name with alphanumeric characters,
periods, or hyphens.
● Phone: 10-15 numeric characters and hyphens
● Guest Count: 1-20
● Table Capacity: 1-20
● Date: Today or future only
● Required: Name, Email, Phone, Table, Date, Time
Technical Challenges & Solutions
1. Double-Booking Prevention
● Database unique constraint on (table_id, date, time_slot)
● Application-level availability check
● Pessimistic locking during transactions
2. Data Consistency
● Hibernate transaction management with rollback
● Foreign key constraints
● Soft delete for reservations
3. User Experience
● Clean JavaFX interface
● Dynamic ComboBox population
● Real-time validation feedback
4. Performance
● C3P0 connection pooling
● Indexed columns (date, time_slot)
● Efficient HQL queries
5. Data Integrity
● Foreign key constraints
● Hibernate entity relationships
● Cascade operations
